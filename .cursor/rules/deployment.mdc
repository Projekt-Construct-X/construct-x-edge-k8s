# Deployment and Operations Rules

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

- Validate Helm charts with `helm lint`
- Test templates with `helm template`
- Verify resource quotas and limits
- Check security configurations
- Validate ingress and service configurations

## Deployment Process

- Use staging environment for testing
- Implement progressive rollouts
- Monitor deployment health
- Have rollback procedures ready
- Document deployment steps

## Configuration Management

- Use environment-specific values files
- Implement proper configuration validation
- Version control all configuration changes
- Test configuration changes in isolation

## Monitoring and Observability

- Implement health checks for all services
- Set up logging aggregation
- Monitor resource utilization
- Track performance metrics
- Set up alerting for critical issues

## Maintenance Procedures

- Regular security updates
- Capacity planning and scaling
- Backup and disaster recovery testing
- Documentation updates
- Dependency updates and vulnerability management

## Edge-Specific Operations

- Handle intermittent connectivity
- Implement local data processing capabilities
- Monitor edge device health and status
- Plan for remote troubleshooting capabilities
- Implement efficient data synchronization
