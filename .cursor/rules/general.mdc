# General Cursor Rules for construct-x-edge-k8s

## Repository Context & Note-Taking

- **ALWAYS** maintain context awareness by taking detailed notes about repository activities
- Before making any changes, read and update `.cursor/notes/session_notes.md` with:
  - Current task or change being made
  - Files being modified and why
  - Key discoveries about the codebase structure
  - Any issues encountered and solutions found
- Store all session notes in `.cursor/notes/` directory
- Use descriptive filenames for different types of notes (e.g., `deployment_notes.md`, `configuration_changes.md`)

## Code Quality

- Maintain consistent YAML formatting
- Use meaningful variable names in values files
- Add comments for complex template logic
- Follow semantic versioning for chart versions

## Documentation

- Update README.md when making significant changes
- Document any new configuration options in values.yaml
- Explain deployment procedures and requirements

## Safety & Best Practices

- Always backup important configurations before major changes
- Use appropriate resource limits and requests
- Follow security best practices for Kubernetes deployments
- Validate changes in development environment first
