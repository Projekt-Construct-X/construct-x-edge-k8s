# Security Rules for Kubernetes Edge Deployments

## Container Security

- Use minimal base images (distroless, alpine)
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Implement proper user contexts (non-root)
- Set read-only root filesystems where possible

## Kubernetes Security

- Implement Pod Security Standards
- Use SecurityContext appropriately
- Apply network policies for traffic control
- Implement proper RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

## Secret Management

- Never commit secrets to git
- Use Kubernetes secrets or external secret managers
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Implement proper secret access controls

## Network Security

- Configure ingress with TLS termination
- Use service mesh for service-to-service communication
- Implement proper network segmentation
- Monitor and log network traffic

## Data Protection

- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper backup and recovery procedures
- Follow data residency requirements
- Implement audit logging

## Edge-Specific Security

- Secure device communication channels
- Implement device authentication and authorization
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts
- Use certificate-based authentication where possible
