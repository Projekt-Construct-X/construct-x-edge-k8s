# Session Notes - construct-x-edge-k8s

## Repository Overview

This is a Helm chart repository for Kubernetes edge deployments with two main subcharts:

- **edc**: Eclipse Dataspace Connector chart
- **weather**: Weather service chart

## Recent Activities

### Initial Setup (Current Session)

- **Date**: Current session
- **Task**: Setting up Cursor rules and note-taking system
- **Changes Made**:
  - Created organized `.cursor/rules/` directory structure with:
    - `general.md` - General development rules and note-taking requirements
    - `kubernetes.md` - Helm and Kubernetes-specific guidelines
    - `security.md` - Security best practices for edge deployments
    - `deployment.md` - Deployment and operations procedures
  - Established `.cursor/notes/` directory structure
  - Implemented note-taking workflow for future context
  - Removed old `.cursorrules` file in favor of organized structure

### Repository Structure Analysis

- **Main Chart**: Located at root level with `Chart.yaml` and `values.yaml`
- **Subcharts**: Two subcharts in `charts/` directory
  - `charts/edc/` - Eclipse Dataspace Connector
  - `charts/weather/` - Weather service
- **Templates**: Kubernetes resource templates in `templates/` directory
- **Ingress**: Configured for external access management

## Key Discoveries

- This appears to be an edge computing platform setup
- Uses Helm for Kubernetes package management
- Modular architecture with separate services
- Includes ingress configuration for routing

### Installation Script Creation (Current Session)

- **Date**: Current session
- **Task**: Create install.sh script for umbrella chart deployment
- **Changes Made**:
  - Created comprehensive `install.sh` script with features:
    - Automated installation into "edc" namespace
    - Chart dependency management via Chart.yaml
    - Kubernetes secrets creation (EDC, Weather, TLS)
    - Pre and post-installation validation
    - Rollback support and error handling
    - Multiple command-line options and dry-run mode
  - Created `DEPLOYMENT.md` comprehensive deployment guide covering:
    - Secrets and dependencies management strategy
    - Production deployment considerations
    - Troubleshooting procedures
    - Security best practices
  - Updated `README.md` with:
    - Installation script usage instructions
    - Updated quick start section
    - Reference to deployment guide
    - Improved uninstall procedures

### Uninstall Script Creation (Current Session)

- **Date**: Current session
- **Task**: Create uninstall.sh script for safe removal
- **Changes Made**:
  - Created comprehensive `uninstall.sh` script with features:
    - Safe removal with confirmation prompts
    - Selective cleanup options (release, secrets, namespace)
    - Dry run mode for previewing changes
    - Comprehensive verification and error handling
    - Detailed logging and post-uninstall information
  - Updated `README.md` with uninstall script documentation
  - Updated `DEPLOYMENT.md` with comprehensive uninstallation section
  - Script supports multiple removal modes from basic to destructive

### Key Implementation Details

- **Install Script**: Atomic installations, secret templates, validation
- **Uninstall Script**: Safe removal, selective cleanup, verification
- **Dependencies**: Managed via Chart.yaml + script for non-chart dependencies
- **Secrets**: Template provided but commented out (uncomment when ready to use)
- **Target**: Pre-existing "edc" namespace assumption

## Next Steps / TODOs

- Continue monitoring and documenting any changes
- Add specific notes for each major modification
- Track configuration changes and their impacts
- Consider adding CI/CD pipeline integration
- Implement external secrets management for production

## Notes Format

Use this file for general session notes. Create specific files for:

- `deployment_notes.md` - Deployment-specific changes
- `configuration_changes.md` - Values and config modifications
- `troubleshooting.md` - Issues and solutions encountered
